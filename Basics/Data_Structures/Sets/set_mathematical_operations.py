# Program to demonstrate set mathematical operations

a = {1,2,3,4,5}
b = {2,4,6,8,10}


# Union: combines all unique elements from both sets

print("Union : ", a | b)

# Intersection: elements common to both sets

print("Intersection : " ,a & b)

# Difference: elements in 'a' but not in 'b'

print("Difference : ", a - b)

# Symmetric Difference: elements in either set, but not in both

print("Symmetric Difference : " , a ^ b)
